<optional issue or PR reference>
```

## Valid Commit Types (verbs):
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting only (no logic change)

- `test`: Adding or improving tests
- `chore`: Build or maintenance changes (CI, tooling, config)
- `perf`: A performance improvement
- `ci`: Continuous integration changes

## üîç Description Guidelines
When adding a description under the summary:
- Explain what changed and why
- Mention relevant context: what bug it fixes, what user story it addresses, or what feature it implements
- If applicable, describe how to test the change or what it affects
- Always refer to related issue/PR numbers using #123 notation
